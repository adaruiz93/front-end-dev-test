<h3>What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)?</h3>
 The technologies that were used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootsrap, CSS Grid, FontAwesome, and Surge to deploy.
 
 I decided to use these technologies because I am familiar with them. Other frameworks I would've done this project in would've been React.js.
 Bootstrap was a big help for the carousel part, that is also a reason I decided to use it.
 
 <h3>Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose?</h3>

 I actually did struggle a bit with CSS Grid. It was my first time working with it. I am more familiar with Flexbox, but I learned so much about Grid and the potential it has while working in this project. 
 
 <h3>What you enjoyed the most and why?</h3>
 I really enjoyed working this project overall. It was challenging, but I am satisfied with the outcome of it. I also enjoyed learning Grid to apply it to this project.
